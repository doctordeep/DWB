### Based on [A11y Dialog](https://www.w3.org/2000/svgedenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/)

[a11y-dialog](https://www.w3.org/2000/svgedenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-dialog/) is a lightweight (1.3Kb) yet flexible script to create accessible dialog windows.log.

### Webpack Jekyll Example

This repo Webpack build was originally taken from

### Jekyll-webpack-boilerplate Quick start

1. Make sure you have all the prerequisites above installed.
2. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/sandoche/Jekyll-webpack-boilerplate.git`
3. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd Jekyll-webpack-boilerplate`.
4. Run `npm install` and `bundler install` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.
5. Run `npm start` to start the development server (or use `npm start`).

### Quick deployment

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sandoche/Jekyll-webpack-boilerplate)

Here is a demo of the Webpack boilerplate Netlify build: https://dazzling-swartz-9738b5.netlify.com

### Development

To start the development server just run  `npm start`

### Folder structure

```md
.
├── pages

└── package-lock.json
```

You can see above the basic structure of the boilerplate and the main differences with the official Jekyll folder structure

### Configurations

* The required configurations are all in `_config.yml`
* Also edit `package.json` the name is used in the meta tags
* If you want a `manifest.json` file please edit `config/webpack.pwa.js`
* Replace the different icon by yours in `_images` and in the root folder

### Assets

* SCSS partials should be located in `_scss` for better reading
* Put all your images in `_images` the content of this folder will be moved to the `_site/assets/images` so you can access them with this path `/assets/images/**` in your templates, check the examples
* Put all your JavaScript files inside `_src` and import them from `index.js` or you can also add them as a new entry point in your Webpack configuration file

### Internationalization

* All the posts should be there in inside `_i18n` folder inside its language, check the boilerplate examples
* You can put your variables inside `_i18n/en.yml` (replace en with your language) and call them in your template with `{% t variable_name.sub_variable %}`
* You can remove the plugin by removing `gem 'jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin'` from `gemfile` and `jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin` from `plugins` in `_config.yml`
* We invite you to read the very good [official documentation](https://github.com/Anthony-Gaudino/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin) of the plugin Jekyll multiple language plugin

## Build

### Optimized website

To build the website run the following line

```sh
npm run build

# or if you want the critical css
npm run build:optim
```

The built website will be in `_site` folder.

You can also run a local server to test it with this command

```sh
npm run serve:dist
```

### PWA

If you want to build a PWA (including the manifest.json and the service worker) run the following. Please ensure to have configured this file `config/webpack.pwa.js`
The built website will be in `_site` folder.

```sh
npm run build:pwa

# or if you want the critical css
npm run build:pwa:optim
```

### Clean assets & \_site folders

This will remove the generated folders

```sh
npm run clean:project
```

## Known issues

* Jekyll watch doesn't reload / rebuild when a translation file is updated inside `_i18n` folder, I recommand to remove `jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin` if you don't want a multi language website and if you want to watch / rebuild faster. Otherwise close and start  `npm run start` to rebuild and see your changes from `_i18n`
* The critical CSS Path may show some weird behavior when the page is loading that is why there are separated npm scripts

## Netlify Identity Widget

A component used to authenticate with Netlify's Identity service.
[Live demo](https://identity.netlify.com)

For a lower level library to the underlying [GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue) API, see
[gotrue-js](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js).

## What is Netlify Identity

Netlify’s Identity service is a plug-and-play microservice for handling site
functionalities like signups, logins, password recovery, user metadata, and
roles. You can use it from single page apps instead of rolling your own, and
integrate with any service that understands JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Learn more about this service from this
[blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/09/07/introducing-built-in-identity-service-to-streamline-user-management/).

## Netlify CMS

This donboulton.com website is a static website but has a administration backend through Netlify CMS.
Adding custom notifications, events, contacts and updates to Netlify CMS _config.yml

Users that register on this site will be added to My Netlify Contacts, Using Zapper to zap users data to Google Contacts, and to my event calendars and zapped to back my repo for a saved locally contacts.json data file which hashes email addresses and other personal for site and Users security.

Events will be displayed on my [events calendar](https://donboulton.com/events/) calendar.
