# Defeat Spambots with dragula

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pages/dragula-logo.png" alt=dragula" caption="Drag and Drop with Drgaula" class="img" %}

This is a simple 12kb flawless way to defeat spambots.

Use a submit button that has to be dragged using dragula to its posting position to post any form.

No bot or computer can figure this out so spam is defeated, except by jerks comments or reviews based on non-sense. Then I just blacklist them in cloudflair and that blocks them from clouflare servers, that will really make there day.

Yea! Goodby recaptcha and honeypots.

## The draggable button

Download [dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) from is dist folder in draguala Github Repo.
Or follow its nmp installation instructions.
