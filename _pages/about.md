# Technical notes about this website

This website is built as static HTML with Jekyll Node React and Webpack, and served on Netlify via a continuous deployment (CD) workflow. Pull requests are automatically built into preview apps, while commits to the master branch trigger the production build and deploy onto Netlifyâ€™s CDN edge node infrastructure. Since the whole site is just a bunch of static files copied onto multiple CDN nodes around the world, time to first byte (TTFB) is consistently fast at around 1ms to 2ms.

## Server-less

No run time dependency or vulnerable server stack required
Pre-built pages served over a CDN for fastest time to first byte
Fast and cheap CDN scaling results in ultra-high availability worldwide
Server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs for reduced attack surface areas
Modern Continuous Deployment (CD) Git workflows with instant rollbacks
Headless CMS for complete separation from your app/site and with full version control
Modern authentication methods such as OAuth 2 for ultimate security.

## Just Moved from ASP. Everything

Whooo what a relief. Ruby Jekyll and GitHub Pages is the kind, figured this out in a few days with the help of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/){: id="open-website" rel="noreferrer"}, and lots of documentation on Ruby, Jekyll with GitHub Pages.

Ruby, Jekyll, GitHub pages, and even liquid are super simple; Or "Super Logical, if you think like a human". I've been hitting my head for not using Ruby and the kind much sooner.

Full Webpack integration of all static assets, Working on react components to replace native Jekyll Menu, footer and page contents.

> Go Sooners!
