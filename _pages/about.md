### Working for Father God
Always worked for Father Creator since the beginning of time. Just hanging out watching our children play; till my day then playtime ends, to my new way.
### Just Moved from ASP. Everything
Whooo what a relif. Ruby Jekyll and Gihub Pages is the kind, figured this out in a few days with the help of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), and lots of documentation on Ruby, Jekyll with Github Pages.
Ruby, Jeckyll, Gihub pages, and even liquid are super simple; Or "Super Logical, if you think like a human". I've been hitting my head for not using Ruby and the kind much eailer.
