title: Buy a Weed
subtitle: Buy me some Weed
description_markdown: >-
   All products are just for testing. Share a big fatty blunt to puff on while I get lost in my digital box. Gods gift to man, it was made illegal because of its mind expanding and healing ability. A little weed every day to keep the doctor away. Had stage 4 liver destruction for 20 years how do you think I am still alive.
