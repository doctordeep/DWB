</p>
<p>I am a self educated Front End Developer, Ive asked only 3 questions on any type of programing in my life I like to figure it out on my own -- Google it. I Just Have fun playing with the latest Web tek stuff.</p>
    
    My last programming class was in Vax Basic - Cobalt & Fortran. 1980's non-sense, no GUI anything.

I do not post much even though I am always building and progressing for a fast no errors Jekyll React Webpack Docker Netlify  Website. If your a programmer or just learning check out my repo for Jekyll liquid code for Gallery's with lightGallery.js, Liquid Staticman Reviews Social feeds and more, with some React and a bad ass Webpack build.

Microdata is perfection in donboulton.com with ratings-reviews and comments and all SEO with no errors & NO-AMP pages necessary, and do not care.

This Website gets A ratings in website speed tests except Google Page testing tools; its, "Google Adds and Tag Manager", lowering my scores.

<p>This site has a11y accessibility with proper color contrasts for my & others disabled viewing; White on Black is much better for most of us to have full Assimilation of the content provided, and less glare.</p>

<h2>Technical notes about this website</h2>

<p>This website is built using markdown content with _includes as Jekyll Components and yaml FrontMatter for individual page content and resources, liquid compiled into static HTML through Jekyll, Node, React and Webpack, Docker Build, and served on Netlify via a continuous deployment (CD) workflow.</p>

Pull requests are automatically built into preview apps, while commits to the master branch trigger the production build and deploy onto Netlify’s CDN edge node infrastructure. 
Since the whole site is just a bunch of static files copied onto multiple CDN nodes around the world, time to first byte (TTFB) is consistently fast at around 1ms to 2ms.

<h3>React Netlify Functions</h3>

<p>Notifications, Comments, Newsletters and Slack Message Hello Me, are using React Forms with Netlify Lambda Functions Pushed to my Slack Mansbooks donboulton.com workspace.</p>
 Comments are moderated through Slack Notifications and then once approved through Lambda functions json sent to Slack, a Notification for approval Shows up on my devices and I approve it then it pushes the Comments data with a build hook to my _ data/comments.json file, then with Jekyll-liquid displayed on the pages.

<h3>Work in progress</h3>

<p> Still working on Making automated pull requests with a build hook to send the Hello Me messages and Newsletters data to Jekyll _data folder .json files; then a site regeneration. Adding the Newsletters to a subscriptions.yaml Without Gulp to trigger to hook rebuilds, as in the JamStack repo, I will build it with GraphQl; It's a work in progress.</p>

<h3>Server-less</h3>

<p>No run time dependency or vulnerable server stack required
Pre-built pages served over a CDN for fastest time to first byte.

Fast and cheap CDN scaling results in ultra-high availability worldwide
Server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs for reduced attack surface areas.</p>
<p>Modern Continuous Deployment (CD) Git workflows with instant rollbacks. 
Headless CMS for complete separation from your app/site and with full version control using
Modern authentication methods such as OAuth 2 within my custom built Netlify Identity Widget on the Jekyll frontend, for ultimate security.</p>

<h2>Netlify CMS Backend</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/" class="external-links target-website">Static + content management = ♥</a></p>

    <h3>An extensible CMS built on React</h3>
   <p> Netlify CMS is built as a single-page React app. Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins or add backends to support different Git platform APIs.</p>
<p> My Netlify CMS backend will build and add Pages, Posts, My layout components with Event data for my GCal fullCalendar localized events, Notifications, Authors, Products, Site Updates and charts data using charts.js displaying build, sales and analytics charts data on individual pages and posts. All from a Static Website!</p>
<h3>Just Moved from ASP. Everything 2/28/2018</h3>

<p>Whooo what a relief no more Visual Studio, ASP.NET or Core 2, "MS stuff"! As of Feb 28th 2018 I have been using VS Code to build with Ruby Jekyll, Markdown, Liquid, React, Webpack using Netlify for a Docker Container with a gzip build; is the kind. Figured Jekyll liquid and how to do the installing the required tools and apps on my Win 10 machine to run Ruby 2.5 and Jekyll 3.7.5 in a few days with the help from 
        <a aria-label="Minimal Mistakes" rel="noreferrer" href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes" class="external-links open-website">
            Minimal Mistakes
        </a>, and lots of documentation on Ruby, Jekyll with Netlify.</p>        

<p>Ruby, Jekyll, GitHub, React and even liquid are super simple; Or "Super Logical, if you think like a human". I've been hitting my head for not using Ruby Jekyll and the kind much sooner.</p>

    <h3 class="external-links"><a href="/calendar/" class="sooners text-center">Go Sooners!</a></h3>
</div>

<p>Webpack build of all site static assets, React a11y dialog components to replace MMistakes Jekyll Menu. Working on the forms and all user interactive page contents to be React Components.</p>

<p>Got the Jekyll part of this site like I want it, the Webpack 3 build is on point, will upgrade to Webpack 4 when it stabilizes, and I can figure it out.</p>
