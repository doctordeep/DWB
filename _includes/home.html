I do not post alot even though I am always building and progressing for a fast no errors Jekyll React Webpack site.

Microdata is perfection in donboulton.com and all seo = NO-AMP pages necessary, and do not care.
<p>This site has a11y accessibility with proper color contrasts for my & others diabled viewing; white on black is much eaiser for alot of us to read and less glare.</p>

<h2>Technical notes about this website</h2>

<p>This website is built with markdown content using liquid compiled into static HTML through Jekyll, Node, React and Webpack, and served on Netlify via a continuous deployment (CD) workflow.</p>

Pull requests are automatically built into preview apps, while commits to the master branch trigger the production build and deploy onto Netlifyâ€™s CDN edge node infrastructure. 
Since the whole site is just a bunch of static files copied onto multiple CDN nodes around the world, time to first byte (TTFB) is consistently fast at around 1ms to 2ms.

<p>React Notifications, Comments and Slack Notifications are using Netilify Lambda Functions Pushed to my Slack Mansbooks donboulton.com workspace.</p>

<h3>Server-less</h3>

<p>No run time dependency or vulnerable server stack required
Pre-built pages served over a CDN for fastest time to first byte
Fast and cheap CDN scaling results in ultra-high availability worldwide
Server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs for reduced attack surface areas
Modern Continuous Deployment (CD) Git workflows with instant rollbacks
Headless CMS for complete separation from your app/site and with full version control
Modern authentication methods such as OAuth 2 for ultimate security.</p>

<h3>Just Moved from ASP. Everything</h3>

<p>Whooo what a relief. Ruby Jekyll and GitHub Pages is the kind, figured this out in a few days with the help from 
        <a aria-label="Minimal Mistakes" rel="noreferrer" href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes" class="external-links open-website">
            Minimal Mistakes
        </a>, and lots of documentation on Ruby, Jekyll with GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>Ruby, Jekyll, GitHub pages, and even liquid are super simple; Or "Super Logical, if you think like a human". I've been hitting my head for not using Ruby and the kind much sooner.</p>

    <h3 class="external-links"><a href="/calendar/" class="sooners text-center">Go Sooners!</a></h3>
</div>


<p>Full Webpack integration of all static assets, React a11y dialog components to replace native Jekyll Menu. Working on the forms and interactive page contents to be React Components.</p>

<p>Got the Jekyll part of this site nailed and pretty much the Webpack 3 build is on point, will upgrade to Webpack 4 when it stabilizes, and I can figure it</p>
